To deal with arrays:

.filter()  - filter with a certain trait
.map() - break down and return the array, you can run a function on each item
.reduce() - combine all items into 1 under a function
.forEach() - iterate through your array
 
for loops - iterate through your array with a starting and ending index (i)

.length - the size of your array
.join() - put together all items in an array into a string with a delimiter
.split() - break down a string into array items
.splice() - remove item from array at an index
.push() - put new item to the end of array
.slice() - slice off a number of items from array with start and end
.includes() - returns true if something is found within the array
.indexOf() - returns the index of what you're looking for


To deal with objects

Object.keys()
Object.values()
Object.entries()
